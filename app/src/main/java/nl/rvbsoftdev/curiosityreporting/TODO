Bugs:

-Hamburger menu button does not work in landscape mode in the Explore and Favorites fragments.
The menu does slide out and works when pulled from the side. Can be solved by disabling setHasOptionsMenu(false) but then there are no menu options.

-Android 11 resolveActivity

-Layout title home
